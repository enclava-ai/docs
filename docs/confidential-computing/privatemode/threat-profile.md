### Privatemode.ai Specific Threat Model

Privatemode.ai addresses unique threats specific to confidential AI inference:

#### Primary Threat Actors

1. **Malicious Cloud Providers**
   - Data center operators with physical access
   - Cloud platform administrators
   - Infrastructure service providers

## Detailed Threat Analysis

### 1. Data Exfiltration Attempts

#### Threat Scenario: Cloud Provider Data Access
**Cloud Provider Data Access Attack Sequence:**
1. Malicious admin gains root access to host system
2. Host attempts to dump TEE memory contents
3. TEE accesses encrypted memory as requested
4. Encrypted data returned (no plaintext available)
5. TEE provides only encrypted data to host system
6. Attacker receives encrypted data with no plaintext access
7. **Result: Attack fails** - Hardware encryption prevents data exposure

*This demonstrates how hardware-enforced encryption protects against privileged insider attacks.*

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct memory access attempts
- Hypervisor-level memory inspection
- Storage volume mounting and inspection
- Network traffic interception

**Privatemode.ai Defenses:**
- **Memory encryption** prevents plaintext access
- **TEE isolation** blocks hypervisor access  
- **End-to-end encryption** protects network traffic
- **Attestation verification** detects compromised environments

**Effectiveness**: 🔴 **High Protection**

### 2. Model Extraction and Inference Attacks

#### Threat Scenario: Model Parameter Extraction
**Model Protection Matrix:**

**Attack Attempts vs TEE Protections:**
- Query-based Extraction → Query Isolation
- Memory Forensics → Memory Encryption  
- Side-channel Analysis → Timing Protection
- API Reverse Engineering → Interface Obfuscation

*Each attack vector is countered by specific TEE-based protection mechanisms.*

**Attack Techniques:**
- **Model Distillation**: Using API responses to train replica models
- **Parameter Probing**: Crafted inputs to infer model weights
- **Gradient Estimation**: Reverse engineering through optimization
- **Architecture Discovery**: Determining model structure through behavior

**Privatemode.ai Mitigations:**
- **Isolated Execution**: Each inference runs in isolated context
- **Output Sanitization**: Responses filtered to prevent information leakage
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents large-scale extraction attempts
- **Attestation**: Verifies model integrity and prevents tampering

**Effectiveness**: 🔴 **High Protection** (with rate limiting)

### 3. Side-Channel and Timing Attacks

#### Threat Scenario: Cross-Tenant Information Leakage
**Side-Channel Mitigation Matrix:**

**Potential Side Channels and Countermeasures:**
- Shared Cache Access → Cache Partitioning
- Memory Bus Timing → Memory Access Randomization
- Power Consumption → Power Noise Injection  
- Network Timing → Response Time Padding

*TEE hardware protections reduce but don't eliminate all side channels - active research area.*

**Side-Channel Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cache-based attacks**: Shared CPU cache inference
- **Timing channels**: Inference time correlation with input content
- **Power analysis**: Energy consumption pattern analysis
- **Memory access patterns**: Inference of data characteristics

**Current Mitigations:**
- **TEE hardware protections** reduce but don't eliminate all channels
- **Timing randomization** in response delivery
- **Resource isolation** through confidential computing
- **Noise injection** in observable metrics

**Effectiveness**: 🟡 **Moderate Protection** (ongoing research area)

### 4. Supply Chain and Infrastructure Attacks

#### Threat Scenario: Compromised Hardware/Software
**Supply Chain Security Matrix:**

**Attack Vectors and Countermeasures:**
- Malicious Hardware → Hardware Attestation
- Compromised Firmware → Firmware Verification
- Backdoored Software → Software Measurements
- Certificate Compromise → Certificate Pinning

*Multi-layered verification ensures supply chain integrity from hardware to application.*

**Attack Scenarios:**
- **Hardware Trojans**: Malicious circuits in TEE processors
- **Firmware Backdoors**: Compromised BIOS/UEFI with TEE access
- **Software Supply Chain**: Compromised vLLM or TEE runtime
- **Certificate Authority Compromise**: Fraudulent attestation certificates

**Verification Mechanisms:**
- **Hardware Root of Trust**: CPU-based attestation chain
- **Reproducible Builds**: Verifiable software compilation
- **Certificate Pinning**: Known-good certificate validation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runtime integrity verification

**Effectiveness**: 🔴 **High Protection** (with verification)
